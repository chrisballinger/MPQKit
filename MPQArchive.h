    @class MPQArchive
    @abstract MPQArchive is the principal class of MPQKit and represents an MPQ archive document.
    @discussion MPQArchive is the principal class of MPQKit and represents an MPQ archive
        document. As such, there is a one-to-one relationship between MPQArchive instances and MPQ archives 
        on disk.
        
        You may create a new MPQArchive instance either with only a file limit parameter, 
        and provide the location of the archive on disk at save time, or create a new MPQArchive 
        with a path and a file limit parameter, in which case the archive file is created right away.
        The first method better matches the Cocoa document model.
        
        Unlike most other MPQ libraries, MPQArchive has deferred operations, meaning the archive on disk 
        is not modified until you explicitly do so. Again, this behavior better matches the Cocoa document model.
        
        It is important to note that MPQArchive is NOT THREAD SAFE, and as such all access to a particular MPQArchive 
        instance should be protected by a lock in applications where multiple threads may access the same MPQArchive 
        instance.
        
        In addition, MPQArchive makes no check at all to see if other MPQArchive instances exist for a particular 
        archive file. There are obvious coherency issues with having multiple MPQArchive instances refer to the same 
        archive on disk, unless all instances are read-only.

    @method loadInternalListfile:
    @abstract Loads the internal MPQ listfile into the instance's own internal list of files. Helps to get valid file
        paths when using the file information routines.
    @discussion Each MPQArchive instance has a list of the files inside its archive. Because MPQs don't inherently 
        store the list of files they contain, Blizzard has gone around this by manually managing a file inside 
        archives called (listfile) which stores the files stored in the archive, one entry per line.
        
        There are several advantages to having the path of a file, such as being able to re-compress it and/or re-encrypt it in 
        operations such as compaction. Without the path, it would be quasi-impossible to perform those operations. 
        Note that whenever you try to open a file of the archive, the MPQArchive instance will add the path 
        you used to open the file to its internal list of files if the file is actually found. You may also 
        add external file lists (available from the web) to the instance's internal file list using 
        the addListfileToFileList: and addArrayToFileList: methods.
        
        This method attemps to read the archive's internal file list and add its content to the instance's internal list 
        of files. MPQArchive will make sure each entry actually exists before adding it to the list.

    @method writeToFile:atomically:
    @abstract Writes the archive at path.
    @discussion If path is the same as the path that was used to initialize the instance, 
        the archive file is modified directly. If path is different than the path used to initialize 
        the instance, a new file is created at path and a new archive is written there (save-as operation). 
        Furthermore, the archive path of the instance is changed to the new path and the old archive is closed.
        
        If the archive was not initialized with a path, a new file is created at path and the path of the 
        instance is set to path.
        
        In all cases, setting atomically to YES makes the instance close the archive file (if there is one) and 
        create a new temporary archive file which will be moved to path once it has been fully written to disk. 
        Note that the temporary file is actually a copy of the original archive file, so if the archive is embedded 
        in some other file, all data not belonging to the archive is preserved.
        
        In all cases, if the method returns NO and atomically was YES or path was different from the instance's 
        initial path, the instance will be exactly as it was prior to the invocation. Otherwise, there are no garantees 
        on the state of the archive on disk or of the instance.
    @param path The location where to save the archive. Must not be nil.
    @param atomically If atomically is YES, modifications are performed on a copy of the archive which is moved 
        to the final destination only at the end. Requires as much free space as the size of the archive, plus any 
        additional space required for new files or other operations on the archive that may increase its size.
    @result Returns YES if writing was sucessful or NO if an error occured. On error, if flag was YES, the instance 
        is re-initialized with the original archive on disk (if there was an original). The instance is 
        marked as not modified if this method succeeds.
